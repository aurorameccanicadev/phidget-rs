# phidget-sys

Low-level unsafe wrpper around the `phidget22` library for interacting with [Phidget](https://www.phidgets.com/) devices.

It was originally created for use with the [phidget](https://crates.io/crates/phidget) crate.
 
This is primarily a set of [bindgen](https://crates.io/crates/bindgen)-generated bindings of the `phidget22.h` header file and linkage to the library.
